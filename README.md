My Desktop Planner - Task Planning Application

## Description
My Desktop Planner is a task planning application designed to help users effectively organize their daily activities and manage their time efficiently. The application allows multiple users to install it on their machines, providing personalized task planning and scheduling features.

## Key Features

- **User Profiles**: Each user is identified by a unique username and can create their own task schedule.
- **Task Management**: Users can input tasks into their personal calendar, including task name, duration, priority (Low, Medium, High), and optional deadline.
- **Task Categorization**: Tasks can be categorized into different categories such as studies, work, hobby, sport, health, etc. Users can assign colors to tasks within the same category for easy identification. They can also add a new category with its color in the parameters.
- **Project Management**: Users can create projects with a name, description, and a set of tasks associated with the project. They can also visualize the states of achievements of these projects.
- **Manual and Automated Task Scheduling**: Users can manually schedule tasks by selecting available time slots on the calendar or let the application automatically schedule them based on user-defined free time slots and minimum slot duration. The minimum slot duration is enforced during decomposition and can be modified in the parameters.
- **Planning Requests**: Users define a specific period for task planning, considering task deadlines. Unscheduled tasks are flagged as such.
- **Simple and Decomposable Tasks**: Tasks can be simple or decomposable. Simple tasks can only be scheduled in a single slot and can be set to repeat periodically. Decomposable tasks can be scheduled in multiple slots until the total duration is reached, and their sub-tasks inherit the same name with an appended number. Of course, you can change the tasks' names at any given time.
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Users can update the status of tasks as not realized, completed, in progress, canceled, or delayed.
- **Daily Task Target**: Users can set a minimum number of tasks to complete per day. Upon reaching this target, the system provides encouraging messages. Consistently achieving the target multiple times awards badges such as "Good," "VeryGood," and "Excellent."
- **Statistics and Insights**: Users can access various statistics, including daily task completion rate, average daily performance, number of badges earned, most productive day, time spent on tasks in different categories, and historical planning data.
- **History**: Users can access past planning data, including completed tasks, earned badges, and historical statistics.
